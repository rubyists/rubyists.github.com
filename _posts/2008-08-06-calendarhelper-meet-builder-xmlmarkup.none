<p>
Your choices for calendar builders for rails aren't many, but the <a href="http://topfunky.net/svn/plugins/calendar_helper">CalendarHelper plugin</a> originally by Jeremy Voorhis has worked well for me&mdash;that is until I needed to drastically change the HTML it outputs.  Immediately after digging in to the code I found the following comment: "TODO Use some kind of builder instead of straight HTML."  Read on for my conversion of CalendarHelper to use Builder::XmlMarkup.
