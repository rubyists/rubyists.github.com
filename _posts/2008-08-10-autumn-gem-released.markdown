Completed the gemination of Autumn.  Currently the [source](git://rubyists.com/gits/autumn), as well as a [source code browser](http://trac.rubyists.com/trac.fcgi/autumn/browser) are available in our repository.  Hopefully in the coming week Tim can find the time to merge this re-factor in.  Thank's to drnic and everyone involved in newgem, Hoe, and RubiGen, they were wonderfully straightforward to use.  Most of the major time spent was learning the ins and outs of these new tools, as well as getting familiar with Rspec.  It's a great weekend when you can accomplish a set goal (gem autumn) and Sharpen the Saw (learn Rspec) at the same time.  I've attached the completed autumn gem to this post and [here](http://rubyists.com/autumn/autumn-3.0.1.gem) if you're interested in a preview.
