  This weekend has been spent creating a gem out of [autumn](http://github.com/RISCfuture/autumn/tree/master).  The autumn IRC framework has allowed us to create single-purpose and very complex IRC (and Jabber) bots which manage workflows for both fun and profit.  It allows you to create such a workflow processer with a minimum amount of code utilizing a rails-like structure.
