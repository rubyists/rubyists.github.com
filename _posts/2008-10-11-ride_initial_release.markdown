title: RIDE 0.1.1 released
typo_id: 19
---
This is the first public release of RIDE, the successor to rails_editor.  RIDE is meant to be decoupled from rails, and in the
future from ruby in general, incorporating the sugar of the GNUscreen/Vim glue into a system for editing Ruby, Common Lisp, and 
later other languages and project types.  Comments on the install/configuration/usage of this release are highly desired.  Check it out
with gem install ride or at http://rubyforge.org/ride
