This is a fairly minor bugfix (thanks diegoviela) to fix the Playback app.  The 0.4.4 should be available via gem.  

Mostly i'm sorry this blog has been so idle, we've been working hard on FSR, FXC, and related components, but much of it on commercial or proprietary projects.  In the coming months we'll be using this knowledge to release applications which enhance the functionality of open source telecom.  

Thanks to all the new contributors, and welcome to the core team Harry Vandberg.  He's pushed development along while we played end user for a few months, we're happy to have him.
