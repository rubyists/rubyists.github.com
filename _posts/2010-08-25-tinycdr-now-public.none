A small internal project we'd used for raw storage of FreeSWITCH CDR data has now been resurrected.  This iteration adds the logging of the full XML posted by FreeSWITCH into a couchdb data source, with a link to the id of the couch record stored in the postgres (or other Sequel-supported database) record.  We'll be adding reporting over the next week or so, time for ideas is now.  Check http://gitorious.org/tiny_cdr for more info.
