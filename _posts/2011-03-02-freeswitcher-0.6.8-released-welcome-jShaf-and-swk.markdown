title: Freeswitcher 0.6.8 Released. Welcome jShaf and swk
---
It's been a long time since a blog post, we'll claim DayJob for that.

This release is a culmination of quite a few changes, including:

 * mod\_callcenter support with the call\_center command
 * conference support with the conference command
 * more apps: pre\_answer, riny\_ready, uuid\_transfer, sched\_hangup
 * Improved Inbound listener with reconnect support and better logging

jShaf and swk have jumped in and been helping on FSR and projects surrounding it, we 
welcome their contributions.
