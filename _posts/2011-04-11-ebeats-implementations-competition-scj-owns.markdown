title: Ebeats Competition Leaderboard scj Killing It
---
scj is claiming victory early in the [Ebeats Competition](http://rubyists.github.com/2011/04/01/show-us-your-beats-earn-a-pizza.html),
 as his lead is (his words) insurmountable now.
He's implementent ebeats in everything from prolog to postscript, and he spits
on the idea of anyone catching his couple-dozen implementation lead.

We're happy to reward scj for his efforts, but would love to see him sweat a bit
with some competition, especially in light of all the easy languages still
available.  None of the BASICs, the pre-sql dbs, not even a pure shell (zsh/ksh lovers?).

Keep in mind once this competition is over the next will begin.  Perhaps it will be golfing,
 perhaps something more (or less) interesting.  Keep on the lookout;  one thing is certain,
 the bounty will raise.
