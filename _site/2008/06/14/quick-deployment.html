<p>The other day, when I was working on upgrading our in-house rbot at the office, I found it a good opportunity to convert one of our old Mongrelized application services to Lighttpd+FastCGI. It is a service that deals with images in a queue that come in with our HylaFAX server. The total migration took about 15 minutes. The gains in speed and efficiency were enormous.</p>
