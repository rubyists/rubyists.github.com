<p>I use firebug for all of my javascript debugging.  It&#8217;s an excellent application, but one thing that has always bothered me is that rail&#8217;s built-in <span class="caps">RJS</span> exception handler shows it&#8217;s output in an alert.  Firebug has the very handy console.log() function.  Why can&#8217;t rails use that?</p>
<p>Now it can.</p>
