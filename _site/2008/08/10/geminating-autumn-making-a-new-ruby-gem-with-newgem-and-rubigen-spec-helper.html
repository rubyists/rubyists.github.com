<p>This weekend has been spent creating a gem out of <a href='http://github.com/RISCfuture/autumn/tree/master'>autumn</a>. The autumn IRC framework has allowed us to create single-purpose and very complex IRC (and Jabber) bots which manage workflows for both fun and profit. It allows you to create such a workflow processer with a minimum amount of code utilizing a rails-like structure.</p>
