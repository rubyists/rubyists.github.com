<p>Fixes in this release include</p>

<ul>
<li>(re)-inclusion of a generic .vimrc which loads the REAL_HOME/.vimrc and adds REAL_HOME/.vim to the vim runtimepath.</li>

<li>Modifying the standard .irbrc to not load standard_error_hooks by default, you must now set the environment variable RIDE_DEBUG if you want the debug hooks, the method which RIDE uses to open files where exceptions were raised.</li>

<li>Specs now leave each template_type in a separate directory to they can be inspected individually.</li>

<li>Default behavior now is to edit a Ramaze tree. Rails and NewGem/Generic Ruby functionality are still available.</li>
</ul>
