<p>One of my favorite things about the newest release of <a href='http://adhearsion.com'>Adhearsion</a> is it’s <a href='http://docs.adhearsion.com/display/adhearsion/Components'>component system</a>.</p>

<p>The component system is designed to provide an easy interface to developing plug-ins for Adhearsion that may be easily shared among the Adhearsion community.</p>

<p>I recently had to create a new component for my app, <a href='http://queue-tip.rubyforge.org'>Queue-Tip</a>. This component takes the result of the AMI command QueueStatus (ManagerInterface#send_action ‘QueueStatus’) via DRb and sorts it into a hash so that it can easily be used pragmatically.</p>
