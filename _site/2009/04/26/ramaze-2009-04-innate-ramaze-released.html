<p>With the release of <a href="http://github.com/rack/rack">Rack 1.0</a>, the release of the refactored <a href="http://github.com/manveru/ramaze">Ramaze</a> which utilizes <a href="http://github.com/manveru/innate">Innate</a> is now available.  This is  a major change from Legacy Ramaze, though attention was paid to as much backwards compatibility as possible.  For a complete reference to the new Ramaze, see <a href="http://book.ramaze.net">the Ramaze Book</a>.  I'd like to thank manveru and the rest of the Ramaze team for all the work leading up to this release, and look forward to upgrading the few apps I don't already have running on innate-ed ramaze.  A small bit about this release:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the ramaze command - most old syntax is supported, but a newer syntax is going to be standard going forward.  For example,  <code>ramaze  start myapp.pid -D </code> Would start ramaze, using myapp.pid to store the pid information, as a (-D) daemon on the default port (7000).  <code>ramaze status</code> Would give the status of a running instance of a daemon. <code>ramaze -h</code> to see the new usage options.</li>
    <li>config.ru - has replaced start.ru for the rackup usage (also used by ramaze start|stop)  This is one critical file needed if you plan on porting an old ramaze app to innate-ed ramaze.</li>
    <li>controllers - are now instances of Innate::Node, and can be grouped in an application namespace.  This allows for easy sharing of controller code among applications.  A bit of this power is described in <a href="http://book.ramaze.net/#_actions">the Ramaze Book</a>.</li>
    <li>Helpers - Some helpers have been renamed, notably form_helper to sequel_form see the Helpers section of the book for a list of all the supported helper names and usages</li>
</ul>
<p>These only touch on the surface of the new changes, an official release document is upcoming.</p>
