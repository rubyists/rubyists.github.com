While working on a project that required Ruby 1.9, I discovered that the FCGI library had not been ported yet to 1.9.  So, I did some googling, and found what sort of changes needed to be made to native extensions to make it work. The result is below in a patch applied to <strong>fcgi.c</strong> of version 0.8.7 from the Rubygem.  If I can get time, I'll post it on github and gem it up for easier installation.
