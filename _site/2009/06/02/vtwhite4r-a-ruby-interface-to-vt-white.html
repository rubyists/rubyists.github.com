Vtwhite4r is a Ruby interface for the <a href="http://www.vtwhite.com">VT White</a> Provisioning Web API service.  It allows VTWhite users to search, add, and remove DIDs from their account.  This is rather useful in the situation where one has clients that he'd like to provision new numbers for, without having to get in the middle and complete the process.

It depends on <em>nokogiri</em> and <em>rest-client</em>.  I've published it on github at <a href="git://github.com/deathsyn/vtwhite4r.git">git://github.com/deathsyn/vtwhite4r.git</a>

I've also built the gem on their repository.
