<p>This is a fairly minor bugfix (thanks diegoviela) to fix the Playback app. The 0.4.4 should be available via gem.</p>

<p>Mostly i&#8217;m sorry this blog has been so idle, we&#8217;ve been working hard on FSR, FXC, and related components, but much of it on commercial or proprietary projects. In the coming months we&#8217;ll be using this knowledge to release applications which enhance the functionality of open source telecom.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the new contributors, and welcome to the core team Harry Vandberg. He&#8217;s pushed development along while we played end user for a few months, we&#8217;re happy to have him.</p>
