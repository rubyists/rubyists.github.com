  <h2>The Rubyists</h2>
  <p>
    The Rubyists are a group of experienced information technology, networking,
    programming, and telecommunications experts who collaborate on solving
    problems in the Ruby programming language.

  <p>
    As we find, in our DayJobs or life in general, solutions to problems, many
    times those solutions can be of use to others.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here we try and share those lessons.  The most popular projects from our
    authors are available below.  See the Code link for more projects.
